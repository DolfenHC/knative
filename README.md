## Troubleshooting
Are you seeing curl: (6) Could not resolve host: hello.default.127.0.0.1.sslip.io?

In some cases your DNS server may be set up not to resolve *.sslip.io addresses. If you encounter this problem, it can be fixed by using a different nameserver to resolve these addresses.

The exact steps will differ according to your distribution. For example, with Ubuntu derived systems which use systemd-resolved, you can add the following entry to the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf:

[Resolve]
DNS=8.8.8.8
Domains=~sslip.io.
Then simply restart the service with sudo service systemd-resolved restart.
